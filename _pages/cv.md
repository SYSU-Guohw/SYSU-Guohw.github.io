Research Highlights
======
### 1. Unified Medical Image Segmentation with State Space Modeling Snake (Mamba Snake)
* **Role:** Co-first Author
* **Summary:** Proposed **Mamba Snake**, a deep snake algorithm using State Space Modeling (SSM) to address multi-scale challenges in Unified Medical Image Segmentation (UMIS). Achieved a **3% mDice improvement** over SOTA methods across five clinical datasets.
* **Status:** **Accepted at ACM MM 2025 (CCF-A)**.

### 2. Gradient-aware Adaptive Momentum Evolution Deep Snake Model (GAMED-Snake)
* **Role:** Co-first Author
* **Summary:** Introduced **GAMED-Snake**, which uses a Distance Energy Map Prior (DEMP) and an Adaptive Momentum Evolution Mechanism (AMEM) to improve semantic segmentation in multi-organ tasks, boosting the mDice metric by approximately **2%**.
* **Status:** **Accepted at ICME 2025 (CCF-B)**.

### 3. Text-prompted dual-hEad spatiotemporal Mamba Snake (TEAMS)
* **Role:** Second Author
* **Summary:** Proposed the first multimodal state-space deep snake framework for medical image segmentation, integrating a Text-prompted Collaborative Dual Head Snake (TCDHS) mechanism.
* **Status:** Submitted to the top-tier journal *Medical Image Analysis*.
